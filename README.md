# coLEAGUE

CoLEAGUE is a football application that promotes teambuilding among colleagues. CoLEAGUE combines the friendly competition instilled within fantasy leagues with the excitement of sports betting. Colleagues place individual bets on English Premier League Teams to compete against one another. 

**Methodology**

CoLEAGUE is accessible at https://coleagueapp.herokuapp.com/. On application deployment, the user is prompted to sign into an existing account or register for a new account.

If the user has not joined a company, their company ranking panel will remain empty with the options to join or create a company. The user can change their company and edit their personal information at any time using the edit button in their profile. Additionally, the user's profile page offers the user to delete their account and clear their information from the database. For rules, coLEAGUE provides an FAQ page.
